============

My assignments for COMP1406 programming course @ Carleton University, winter 2014

- All the code is published under MIT License (see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file) with the condition that I don't let you submit _my_ code as _your_ work :wink:.
- All the credit for the PDF files (assignment descriptions) go to [Mark Lanthier](http://people.scs.carleton.ca/~lanthier/).

WARNING: Crappy code [kind of]! :grin:
